# template

minimal b2b saas (not b2b but i like buzzwords) template. has a blank homepage, blank dashboard, email password login, and admin panel provided by pocketbase because i do not like being tied to big tech and managing cloud free tiers. it's made for personal use because i do not like writing auth.

## stack

- next.js
- shadcn ui
- tailwind
- pocketbase (sqlite)

## deploy

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
